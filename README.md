## What is calorie ？

The calorie chain is implemented by golang. It is based on the bottom layer of chain33.Bernoulli blockchain &amp; Intelligence Lab released the calorie in 2019.
Calorie is a highly modular and pluggable blockchain architecture. It provides the best scheme and choice for engineers to issue digital currency or public chain. Calorie chain has created "planetary chain" to solve the shortcomings of the previous chain not interworking, and introduced the concept of smart contract 3.0, which can introduce the data out of the chain into the smart contract, so that the smart contract becomes more practical.



## Features of calorie

● Hybrid blockchain architecture

● Distributable parallel chain

● Access to data outside the chain

● Atomic transaction (cross chain transaction)



## Developer community

Welcome to the calorie developer community. There are many excellent golang engineers and blockchain enthusiasts. Here, you will get technical support to help you develop all kinds of dapps around the calendar. At the same time, you can issue your own token on the calorie, or build your own independent parallel chain, and carry out ecological construction on your own parallel chain.
